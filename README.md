## JalDoot
Our application simplifies the process of reporting water concerns, from citizens by utilizing intelligence and computer vision technologies. This allows for categorization of issues expediting emergency responses. Users can capture and upload geo-tagged images that're geo-tagged providing location data. Real time mapping is then utilized to aid in making decisions. Key features include the integration of AI and machine learning accurate geo-referenced images, real time mapping capabilities, efficient emergency response protocols, data-driven decision-making processes, and enhanced community engagement.

## Dependencies / Show stopper here

-##Internet Speed and Accessibility: Our application is designed to work with slower 2G internet speeds ensuring that users, in remote areas can easily report any water related issues they encounter. Additionally we have included support for languages to make sure that users can interact with the app in their language. In case of emergencies we have implemented notifications to provide alerts.

-##Data Privacy: The privacy of user data is of importance to us. We have taken measures such as encryption and anonymization to protect user information. Our privacy policies are transparent. We have put consent mechanisms in place to ensure that users have control over their data.

-##Scalability: We understand the importance of being able to accommodate a growing number of users. That's why our app has a infrastructure that is ready to scale up as our user base expands.

-##Accuracy of Analysis: We are constantly working on improving the accuracy of our computer vision models so that they can effectively categorize types of water problems. Through research and updates, in machine learning techniques we aim to provide accurate analysis.
